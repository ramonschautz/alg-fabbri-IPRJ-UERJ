## Tooling

Create a separate folder for the list exercise/homework due today,
other than the old 'merge' --> make everything build

Then create a new one 'sort' for general sorting


## Continuing with AI 

### Ask it to write a function to sort vectors!
- The vectors of unsigned char elements, but can be small or up to 1MB in size.
- The tests must include a benchmark of runtime
- Run and see the code
- Now write your own and test
- Verify that corner cases are tested, if not add them

### Prof: Introduce Bsort
- by hand vs AI
- concept of O(n) vs O(nË†2) or O(nlogn)

### Evaluation / scoring
- Eval each item in of Tarefa 3

## List exercise 30min
- Who have everything working gets grading for homework
- In class: Finish your list editor homework 100%
    - Oly get grade if 100% finished
- May use AI
